# Use the following link for access to the Sequential Oligogenic Linakge Analysis Routines
# SOLAR requires a Linux environment to run on.
http://solar-eclipse-genetics.org/
# SOLAR manual can be found at 
https://hpc.nih.gov/docs/solar-8.1.1/00.contents.html

# SOLAR requires two types of files 

# The pedigree file should be in CSV format with the following columns necessary "Pedfile.csv"
Family ID, Father ID, Mother ID, Individual ID

# Phenotype file should be in CSV format with the following columns necessary. This file may contain multiple related phenotypes. "Phenfile.csv" 
Family ID, Individual ID, Phenotype A, Phenotype B

#Initalize Solar
